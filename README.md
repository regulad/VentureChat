# VentureChat

This repo is a GitHub remote of the BitBucket project [VentureChat](https://bitbucket.org/Aust1n46/venturechat/src/master/).

If you want to develop, you are probbaly looking for the [`master`](https://github.com/regulad/VentureChat/tree/master) branch.

Due to a weird way GitHub actions work, only the branch selected as a main branch will run Actions.
